But,” he said, “you cannot see my face, for no one may see me and live.” Then the Lord said, “There is a place near me where you may stand on a rock. 22 When my glory passes by, I will put you in a cleft in the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by. Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”  (Exodus 33:19-23)

    - Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle.
