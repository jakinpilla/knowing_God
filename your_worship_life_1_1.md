    - 성경이 분명히 가르쳐주시는 한 가지는 "예배는 자신을 계시하시는 하나님을 아는 지식에 달려 있다"는 점이다. 만약 하나님께서 먼저 자신을 알리지 않으셨더라면 진실된 예배가 불가능하였을 것이다. 이것이 구약성경에 나타나 있는 예배의 기본 원리이다.

Then I will remove my hand and you will see my back; but my face must not be seen.”  (Exodus 33:19-23)

    - Then the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Moses could not enter the tent of meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. In all the travels of the Israelites, whenever the cloud lifted from above the tabernacle, they would set out; but if the cloud did not lift, they did not set out—until the day it lifted. So the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and fire was in the cloud by night, in the sight of all the Israelites during all their travels.  (Exodus 40:34-38)

    - The trumpeters and musicians joined in unison to give praise and thanks to the Lord. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals and other instruments, the singers raised their voices in praise to the Lord and sang: “He is good; his love endures forever.” Then the temple of the Lord was filled with the cloud, and the priests could not perform their service because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the temple of God.

    - When all the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord above the temple, they knelt on the pavement with their faces to the ground, and they worshiped and gave thanks to the Lord, saying, “He is good; his love endures forever.”

    - Shout for joy to the Lord, all the earth.
    Worship the Lord with gladness;
    come before him with joyful songs.
    Know that the Lord is God.
    It is he who made us, and we are his;
    we are his people, the sheep of his pasture.

    Enter his gates with thanksgiving
    and his courts with praise;
    give thanks to him and praise his name.
    For the Lord is good and his love endures forever;
    his faithfulness continues through all generations. (Psalm 100)

    - Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord:

    “I will sing to the Lord,
    for he is highly exalted.
    Both horse and driver
    he has hurled into the sea.

    “The Lord is my strength and my defense;
    he has become my salvation.
    He is my God, and I will praise him,
    my father’s God, and I will exalt him.
    The Lord is a warrior;
    the Lord is his name.
    Pharaoh’s chariots and his army
    he has hurled into the sea.
    The best of Pharaoh’s officers
    are drowned in the Red Sea.
    The deep waters have covered them;
    they sank to the depths like a stone.
    Your right hand, Lord,
    was majestic in power.
    Your right hand, Lord,
    shattered the enemy.

    “In the greatness of your majesty
    you threw down those who opposed you.
    You unleashed your burning anger;
    it consumed them like stubble.
    By the blast of your nostrils
    the waters piled up.
    The surging waters stood up like a wall;
    the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
    The enemy boasted,
    ‘I will pursue, I will overtake them.
    I will divide the spoils;
    I will gorge myself on them.
    I will draw my sword
    and my hand will destroy them.’
    But you blew with your breath,
    and the sea covered them.
    They sank like lead
    in the mighty waters.
    Who among the gods
    is like you, Lord?
    Who is like you—
    majestic in holiness,
    awesome in glory,
    working wonders?

    “You stretch out your right hand,
    and the earth swallows your enemies.
    In your unfailing love you will lead
    the people you have redeemed.
    In your strength you will guide them
    to your holy dwelling.
    The nations will hear and tremble;
    anguish will grip the people of Philistia.
    The chiefs of Edom will be terrified,
    the leaders of Moab will be seized with trembling,
    the people of Canaan will melt away;

    terror and dread will fall on them.
    the power of your arm
    they will be as still as a stone—
    until your people pass by, Lord,
    until the people you bought pass by.
    You will bring them in and plant them
    on the mountain of your inheritance—
    the place, Lord, you made for your dwelling,
    the sanctuary, Lord, your hands established.

    “The Lord reigns
    for ever and ever.” (Exodus 15:1-18)


    On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song:

    “When the princes in Israel take the lead,
    when the people willingly offer themselves—
    praise the Lord!

    “Hear this, you kings! Listen, you rulers!
    I, even I, will sing to the Lord;
    I will praise the Lord, the God of Israel, in song.

    “When you, Lord, went out from Seir,
    when you marched from the land of Edom,
    the earth shook, the heavens poured,
    the clouds poured down water.
    The mountains quaked before the Lord, the One of Sinai,
    before the Lord, the God of Israel.

    “In the days of Shamgar son of Anath,
    in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned;
    travelers took to winding paths.
    Villagers in Israel would not fight;
    they held back until I, Deborah, arose,
    until I arose, a mother in Israel.

    God chose new leaders
    when war came to the city gates,
    but not a shield or spear was seen
    among forty thousand in Israel.
    My heart is with Israel’s princes,
    with the willing volunteers among the people.
    Praise the Lord!

    “You who ride on white donkeys,
    sitting on your saddle blankets,
    and you who walk along the road,
    consider 11 the voice of the singers at the watering places.
    They recite the victories of the Lord,
    the victories of his villagers in Israel.

    “Then the people of the Lord
    went down to the city gates.
